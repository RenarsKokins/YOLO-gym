# YOLO gym - labeling software for neural networks
Yolo gym is used to label images so that they can be used to train neural networks. I mainly made it because I wanted to label images for my [aimbot](https://github.com/RenarsKokins/darknet_aimbot) project which needed custom weights. It is made using C# and is compatible with YOLO-type labeling system.

# Controls
`a` - previous image
`d` - next image
`s` - save label in image folder
`z` - clear last marking
`c` - clear all markings
`del` - clear selected marking (in bounding boxes tab)
`1-9` - select corresponding label
`scrollwheel` - select next/previous label
`left mouse` - draw marking
`right mouse` - move marking (mouse has to be on a marking)
